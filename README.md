# Application-of-Naive-Bayes-and-Linear-Regression-Model

## Naive Bayes Model
### Problem Statement
Nowadays, for convenience and time saving, people mostly travel by flight. Therefore, air traffic control is important to ensure the aircraft is safely and efficiently through the airspace system. Hence, air traffic control would like to improve the effectiveness of the airspace system, which has played a significant role in economic and demographic growth. Thus, an analysis is done using the Naïve Bayes model to identify the association between each feature such as GEO.Summary, GEO.Region, Terminal with the number of passengers, which is conducted using the Air Traffic Passenger data from 2005 to 2016. The main idea behind this analysis is described as follows:
1. To investigate passengers’ flight preferences.
 2. To find out whether there is an increasing of passenger over the years.
 3. To identify the airport’s region and generate recommendations for air traffic control for better
 efficiency.

## Linear Regression Model
### Problem Statement
Housing price rise over time, though there may be fluctuations or market corrections. Thus, people are concerned about housing prices because they can have a significant impact on their personal finances and overall quality of life. Therefore, an analysis is performed on identifying the association between the features and the housing price using linear regression referring to the 2020_Q4 to 2022_Q1 Housing Price data. The main idea behind this analysis is listed as follows: 
1. To identify the location that tends to increase the housing price.
 2. To investigate the housing price trend over the years.
 3. To enable housing price predictions based on the relationship between the features and housing
 price.
